# N-ary Trees Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of n-ary trees in C. A visual representation of the trees generated is as follows:
> A
> |
> B -- C -- D -- E
> |    |
> |    H -- I
> F -- G
 
- A -> the root node
- B, C, D, E -> children of the root node, all at the same level
- F, G -> children of the B node, at the same level
